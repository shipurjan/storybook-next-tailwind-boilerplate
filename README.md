# storybook-next-tailwind-boilerplate
A minimal boilerplate repository with: 
- Storybook
- opinionated sample components (using [class-variance-authority](https://cva.style/docs/getting-started/variants) to create reusable component variants, paired with TailwindCSS)
- pre-configured husky git hooks that check code linting and compile the code with `tsc` before each commit

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shipurjan/storybook-next-tailwind-boilerplate
cd storybook-next-tailwind-boilerplate
pnpm i
pnpm storybook
```
